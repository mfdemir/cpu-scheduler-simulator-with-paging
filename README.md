# cpu-scheduler-simulator-with-paging
A C# Windows Forms project that simulates cpu scheduling and memory paging that uses different scheduling algorithms and using different page replacement algorithms. You can set process count, max burst time and max arrival time and program generates random processes according to the paramters you gave. You should also enter page count number and working set size. Finally you should set your 'Multi Level Feedback Queue' cpu scheduling algorithm and hit 'Generate' button to run this simulator. You can simulate step by step or simulate until next page demand or simulate until all the processes get completed. You can see the stack, gantt chart of time versus processes. You can also see working set content for both 'First In First Out' and 'Least Recently Used' page and frame replacement algorithms to observe their differences.
### Note
This project focuses on paging so not all cpu scheduling algorithms are included in this project. You can only use a 'Multi Level Feedback Queue' with three queues which can be selected as 'Round Robbin' and 'First Come First Serve' cpu scheduling algorithms in this simulator. If you are interesten in other cpu scheduling algorithms, you can check my other cpu scheduler simulator project at https://github.com/mfdemir/cpu-scheduler-simulator .
